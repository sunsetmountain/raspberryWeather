# raspberryWeather

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

In this project, you are going to build Raspberry Pi Internet of Things (IoT) device with a weather sensor that can publish data to the Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Pub/Sub). This can also be extended into building out an entire data and analytics pipeline by following the "Building a Serverless Data Pipeline: IoT to Analytics" [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/)

### Prerequisites

* A Google Cloud Platform account. New users of Google Cloud Platform are eligible for a [$300 free trial](https://console.developers.google.com/billing/freetrial?hl=en)

* [Raspberry Pi Zero W starter kit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-zero-wireless.html) - $34.95

* [USB card reader](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Reader-RS-MMC-Micro/dp/B006T9B6R2) - $9.99

* [USB hub](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Anker-Ultra-Slim-4-Port-USB-3-0-Data-Hub/178554397) (to allow for connecting a keyboard and mouse into the sole USB port on the Raspberry Pi) - $9.99

* [Female-to-female breadboard wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/266) - $3.95

* [GPIO Hammer Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3413) - $6.50

* [BME280 sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0118XCKTG/) - $9.99

* [Soldering iron](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074V28ZVS/) (any will do, but this one is nice and includes solder) - $32.99

* Computer monitor or TV with HDMI input, HDMI cable, keyboard and a mouse

The Raspberry Pi Zero W is recommended for this codelab, but a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B will also work, wonâ€™t require hammer header pins or a USB hub, has a better CPU, but will cost more. If you choose to move forward with the alternate device, make certain that you have a power supply and an appropriate SD card.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
